### Structure

The current structure for these Calyx meetings is that we have one topic per meetings. We pick a topic on a "first come, first served" basis. If we don't have a topic for a given week, no big deal; we just skip. If you don't have write access to this repository, please open a pull request updating this file to propose a topic.

It is usually really helpful to have something written down ahead of time about a given meeting topic; everybody should make an effort to read and comment asynchronously before the meeting. That way, we don't have to waste time recapping the basic idea and can get right into the actual discussion that synchronous meeting time is best suited for.
